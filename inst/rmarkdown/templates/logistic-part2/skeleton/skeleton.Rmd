The real power of linear models is that they let you simultaneously 
look at the impact of a number of separate independent variables.
It's important that we do this all at once, because our indpendent
variables are also associated with each other. For example, being 
a crew member is associated with gender. Let's look at that relationship.
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
load("~/data/RMS_Titanic.Rda")
# Uncomment if you never added labels
#RMS_Titanic$Survival2 <- RMS_Titanic$Survival
#RMS_Titanic$Survival <- as.factor(RMS_Titanic$Survival)
#RMS_Titanic$Survival <- ifelse(RMS_Titanic$Survival == "0", "Died", "Survived")
#RMS_Titanic$SGender <- as.factor(RMS_Titanic$Gender)
#RMS_Titanic$Gender <- ifelse(RMS_Titanic$Gender == "0", "Male", "Female")

#Uncomment if you already added labels to Survival
#RMS_Titanic$Survival2 <- ifelse(RMS_Titanic$Survival == "Died", 0, 1)


```



```{r}
crosstab(Crew ~ Gender, data = RMS_Titanic, format= "col_percent")
```
```{r}
crosstab(Gender ~ Crew, data = RMS_Titanic, format= "col_percent")
```

Is a person's gender related to whether they are a crew member or passenger?
Explain the association.

If you know someone is female, does that help you in terms of guessing if 
they are a crew member?

Now let's remember our glm bivariate models.

```{r}
results <- glm(Survival ~ Gender, data = RMS_Titanic, 
               family = binomial(link = logit))
coefficients(results)
```
```{r}
results <- glm(Survival2 ~ Crew, data = RMS_Titanic, 
               family = binomial(link = logit))
coefficients(results)

```

The problem is, how much of the impact of gender due to the 
females almost completely being passengers? 
How much is the impact of crew due to crew members being
almost completely male?

We need to look at them at the same time in order to *control* for the
impact of the other variable.

We could do a more complex cross tab

```{r}

crosstab(Survival2 ~ Gender + Crew, data = RMS_Titanic, 
         format = "col_percent")

```

What does this table tell us?  

Imagine if we had  three or more variables that we wanted to combine.

Now let's look at the glm.

```{r}
results <- glm(Survival2 ~ Gender + Crew, data = RMS_Titanic, 
               family = binomial(link = logit))
coefficients(results)
```

We have 4 combinations:
- Male Passenger  (Gender = 1, Crew = 1)
- Male Crew  (Gender = 1, Crew = 0)
- Female Passenger (Gender = 0, Crew = 1)
- Female Crew (Gender = 0, Crew = 0)

Write out the prediction equation for each group (use 2 decimals) and 
calculate the predicted logit for each group.  

- Male Passenger
  
  
- Male Crew
  
  
- Female Passenger
  
  
- Female Crew
  
  

Let's use R to do the calculations of the logits and predicted
probabilities.
```{r}
table(results$linear.predictors)
table(fitted.values(results))
```

What is the relationship between the two outputs?


How do these results compare to our crosstab with two independent variables?



\newpage
One thing you should notice is that when we use multiple independent
variables the results of the predicted probabilities no longer 
perfectly match the cross tabs.  This is because there might be a separate
impact of the _combination_ of two variables that is different than that
of each variable separately. So there could be a special effect of 
being a female crew member that is different than the sum of the two 
separate effects.  These kinds of effects are called interactions and are
very common in sociology. 

This shows how to include an interaction in your model.
```{r}
results <- glm(Survival ~ Gender + Crew + Gender*Crew, data = RMS_Titanic, 
                family = binomial(link = logit))
coefficients(results)
```

Notice that there is now one extra coefficient which represents the effect 
of being a male passenger.  For all other groups this coeffecient would
be multiplied by 0 to get the lineor predictions.

```{r}
table(results$linear.predictors)
table(fitted.values(results))
```


Overall, what is the relationship between gender, role on the ship (crew or 
passenger) and survival? Use numbers to support your statements.
