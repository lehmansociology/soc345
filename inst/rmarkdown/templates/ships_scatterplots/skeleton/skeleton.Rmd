```

First let's create two new variables, the number of male passengers and the number of crew members.
Remember that `No. of passengers` is the total passengers, `No. of women passengers` is the number of women
passengers, and `Ship size ` is the total number of people including passengers and crew.
Set up the code below to create the new variables.

````{r}
#type your code here
ships$No_of_male_passengers <- 
ships$No_of_crew <- 

````

Let's also create new dichtomous variables, one for the Titanic and one for your ship.
These will be TRUE if the observation is that ship, FALSE otherwise.

```{r}

ships$Titanic <- ifelse(ships$`Name of Ship` == 'RMS Titanic', TRUE, FALSE)
ships$Titanic
# Now do yours

```
Make sure to check your results in the displayed the values.

Now get the summary data for the number of male passengers, number of women passengers and 
number of crew members.

### How do the three variables compare to each other in terms of cnetral tendency (mean and median) and 
### variation (range and interquartile range)?
(Feel free to use additional R functions of your choice to get this information)

```{r}

```


### All three of these "number" variables are interval variables.  What makes them interval variables?




Do ships with more male passengers have more female passengers?  To explore this one thing we can do
is make a scatterplot using ggplot and geom_point.

```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(ships, aes(x=`No. of women passengers`, y=No_of_male_passengers)) 
  plot1 + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Relationship between the number of male and female passengers")
  


```

## In looking at your results would you say that generally speaking as the number of female passengers
## increases the number of male passengers increases?


## If you increase the number of female passengers by 100 how do you think that would change
## the number of male passengers you would expect? (Just an estimation by eyeball)

Now make the same plot but switch the x and y axes.

```{r}


```

## In looking at your results would you say that generally speaking as the number of male passengers
## increases the number of female passengers increases?


## If you increase the number of male passengers by 100 how do you think that would change
## the number of female passengers you would expect? (Just an estimation by eyeball)




Now do the same thing but with number of crew members as the y variable. 
You can use either number of male passengers or number of female passengers as the x variable.

```{r}



```

## In looking at your results would you say that generally speaking as the number of male or female passengers
## increases the number of crew members increases?


## If you increase the number of male or female passengers by 100 how do you think that would change
## the number of crew you would expect? (Just an estimation by eyeball).

## Based on the change due to change of 100, what would the impact of change of 1 male or 
## female passenger be?

Now rerun two or three of the graphs but add this geom code to them to get a "linear fit" line.

geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)


```{r}

```


## Does the line change your thinking at all?  Based on the line what are the impacts of changing 
## the x variable by 100?  What would the impact of changing by 1 be?


Now let's use R to estimate the slope of the line.  Here is one example, add more corresponding to
the graphs you made above.

```{r}

results1 <- glm(No_of_male_passengers ~ `No. of women passengers`, family = gaussian, data = ships)
coefficients(results1)



```

### How do the coeffcients for your x variables relate to your estimates of change based on increase 
### of 100 and increase of 1?




### How does this glm differ from the glm() we did previously?
