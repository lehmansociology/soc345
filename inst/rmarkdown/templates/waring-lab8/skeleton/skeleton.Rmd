One of the issues we have is that we want to include passenger class in our analysis but we don't want to lose all the data on the cres.
Let's look at the relationship between Passenger Class and Crew as variables using crosstab().

````{r}
crosstab(RMS_Titanic, col.vars = "Crew", type = "f")
# Add a single variable crosstab for "Passenger Status"


# Add a crosstab of "Crew" and "Passenger Class" with "Crew" as the row variable.


# Run this table to see missing values
table(RMS_Titanic$Crew, RMS_Titanic$`Passenger Class`, useNA = "ifany")

````

### Explain how the current variable "Passsenger Class" limits our ability to analyze the data.



## Data Wrangling
Now we want to create a new variable called "Class.Combined" that combines the two variables by adding "Crew" as a status.

```{r}

RMS_Titanic$Class.Combined<- ifelse(RMS_Titanic$Crew == 1, "Crew", RMS_Titanic$`Passenger Class`)


```

### Explain in words what the above code does.



#Add a crosstab of "Crew" and "Class.Combined" with "Crew" as the row variable.

```{r}

```

Add a crosstab of "Class.Combined" with "Survival" as the row variable and type="c" to get column percents.

```{r}

```

### Write a paragraph summarizing the relationship between Class.Combined and Survival.



We have previously looked at survival by gender.  This time let's look at the combination of Class.Combined and Gender. 

```{r}
crosstab(RMS_Titanic, row.vars = "Survival", col.vars = c("Class.Combined", "Gender"), type = "c")
# Do the same table but change the order of the column variables.

#Do the same table but create a frequency table.

```

### Explain how the three tables relate to each other.



###  Describe the relationship between Gender, Combined.Class and Survival. Remember that survival is the dependent variable.



Now let's add a third variable, Child.  Rememember that for RMS_Titanic we have to create the Child variable.

```{r}
RMS_Titanic$Child <- as.numeric(RMS_Titanic$Age) <= 15

# Run a cross tab with Class.Combined, Gender and Child as column variables and survival as the row variable. 
# You can run several variations if you want.


```


### Describe the combined relationships between the variables.




Overall (using all of the tables above as needed):
#### Does being a child increase or decrease someone's chances of survival compared to not being a child?

#### Does being female (gender = 1 ) increase or decrease someone's chances of survival compared to being a male?


#### Does being a crew member increase or decrease someone's chances of survival compared to being in first class?


#### Does being in third class increase or decrease someone's chances of survival compared to being in first class?


#### Does being a crew member increase or decrease someone's survival compared to being in third class?


Does this seem to be getting a bit complex? That is one reason why sociologists will often switch to a linear model. 
These may seem complex at first but compared to reading a complex crosstab they may be easier. 

Here's how to run a linear model called a logistic regression. Just run it.

```{r}

results<-glm(Survival~Class.Combined + Gender + Child, data=RMS_Titanic, family = binomial(link = logit))
coef(results)

```

We are going to discuss this together, but for right now:

#### Is the sign of ChildTRUE positive or negative?


#### Is the sign of Gender (being female in this case) positive or negative?

#### Is the sign of Class.CombinedCrew (being a crew member) positive or negative?

#### Is the sign of Class.Combined3 (being in 3rd Class) positive or negative?

#### Is the size (absolute value) of Class.CombinedCrew bigger or smaller than Class.Combined3?

#### How do these answers compare with the answers about the cross tabulation?
