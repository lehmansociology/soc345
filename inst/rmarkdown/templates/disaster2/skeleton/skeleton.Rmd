```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')

```

Now that we have our data sets set up let's take a look at them and start 
to analyze what happened. (And learn some R basics along the way.)

Let's focus on the Titanic.

Start by loading the dataset that you previously saved.

````{r}
  load(paste("~","data/RMS_Titanic.Rda", sep="/"))
# Do the same thing but for  your ship.


````
## Describing the Data

The data we downloaded contains 1 row per person on the ship for a given ship, in this case RMS Titanic and your ship.

Find some basic information about the data for your ship using the str() function and the summary()
function on the RMS_Titanic data set. That means, put the name of the data set inside 
the parentheses.
```{r}
str(PUT_THE_DATA_SET_NAME_HERE)
summary(PUT_THE_DATA_SET_NAME_HERE)

```

You will probably notice some odd things.

####Some variables are all set to NA.  Which ones are these?


We need to pay attention to the fact that there are some variables not available for all 
of the ships. When a variable is not available, all values will be missing.


#### There are some variables where all the values are the same. Which are these?


#### Why do some variables have the same value for every observation?  Think about what they refer to. (Think back to the ships data)


#### Browse the dataset.  There is something interesting about how the Crew and Passenger Class variables relate to each other.  What is that?


### Tables

Now let's get some descrptive information about the people on the ship using the frequency() function. The variables we are interested in in the RMS_Titanic data set are: 
Gender,  Crew, Survival and any other variables that are nominal or ordinal and have data. 

Remember the code will look like this:
frequency(YOUR_SHIP_DATA$variable)


```{r}



```

Are there any interval variables? If so run a summary() function for them.

```{r}


```


Now run at least three cross tabs.  The dependent variable (row.vars) should be Survival
for all of them.  The two shared variables are Crew and Gender. Pick one other variable
describing individual people.

Remember that the code will look like:
crosstab(DATASET, row.vars="", col.vars="", title="", format="col_percent")


```{r}



```




### Summary

Write a paragraph describing the people who were on board your ship and what happened to them.
