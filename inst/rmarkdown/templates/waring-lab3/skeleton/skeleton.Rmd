title: "Visualizing Interval Ratio Variables"

This template will begin the exploration of interval ratio variables in  the _ships_ data 
set as a whole. This will let us do two things
 - describe the overall distribution of the ships data.
 - describe how your ship compares to this overall distribution.
 
Start by loading the lehmansociology library.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
# Let's rename the Length of Voyage  variable to a shorter name with no spaces.
ships <-dplyr::rename(ships, 
                      Days = `Length of voyage`, 
                      Women_passengers = `No. of women passengers`)
```
Here are the values of Days (Length of voyage in days) in their original order and sorted.
Add in the code to get the data on Women_passengers.
````{r}
ships$Days
sort(ships$Days)
````

Let's represent this data visually using  a Cleveland dot plot. This shows each of the individual points for the ships. We will do it with the data sorted.  Notice that this is different from the
Wilkerson dot plots we have made before (and which we will make later in this template). 

```{r}
    ggplot(ships, aes(y=reorder(`Name of Ship`, Days) , x=Days ))+
        geom_point() +
        geom_segment(aes(yend = `Name of Ship`), xend = 0, color = "grey50") +
        ggtitle("Length of Voyage in Days in the Ships Data") +
        ylab("Name of Ship")

```

Make a Wilkerson dot plot for the number of women passengers. 

```{r}



```


#### Summarize your two plots in a paragraph. Describe the overall distribution 
#### and where your ship fits in.





In R we have functions that help make it easier to get certain statistics. The example shows how to 
get the minimum.  Get the maximum for Days and for Women_passengers.

The minimum value of Days is `r min(ships$Days)`.
The maximum value of Days is `r  `.



## Displaying interval and ratio variables

There are a number of ways to visualize interval data. Two are a Cleveland dot plot and a box and 
whiskers plot.  Below are examples of creating these for the Days variable. 
After trying these and studying how they work, create the same plots for the number of women.

```{r}
ggplot(ships, aes(x = Days)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +
    geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1) +
     ggtitle("Length of Voyage in Days in the Ships Data")

```
Now let's make a box and whiskers plot.

```{r}

ggplot(ships, aes(y = Days, x=factor(0))) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +
    ggtitle("Length of Voyage in Days in the Ships Data")

```

Now let's combine them.

```{r}

ggplot(ships, aes(y = Length, x=factor(0))) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', stackdir='center', binwidth = 1) +
    coord_flip() +
    ggtitle("Length of Voyage in Days in the Ships Data")

```

#### Write a summary of the distributions of the two variables based on the data visualizations.



####All of these graphs, tables and other visualizations display the same information but in different formats.  Describe what you learned from each one and when you might use each one. 

For example, what aspect of the data does each one highlight? What does each one display better or
worse than the others?
