You should have a data set called "myships" in your data folder.  Load that data.  Fill in the correct code for
your data set.


````{r}
load("data/myships.Rdata")
```
To start with we will use `prop_survival` as the y (or dependent) variable.

First, lets make a scatter plot showing the relationship of our dependent variable with `No. of women passengers`  as the x variable, but this time add a color to the aes that differentiates the Titanic from the other ships. 

```{r}
plot0 <- ggplot(ships, aes(x=`No. of passengers`, y=prop_survival) )
plot0 + 
  geom_point()+
  ## Since we keep repeating this we could assign it to an object and just use the name of the object.
  ggtitle("Relationship between the survival rate and number passengers")
 

plot1 <- ggplot(ships, aes(x=`No. of women passengers`, y=prop_survival) )
plot1 + 
  geom_point()+
  ## Since we keep repeating this we could assign it to an object and just use the name of the object.
  ggtitle("Relationship between the survival rate and number of female passengers")
 

plot2 <- ggplot(ships, aes(x=`Women passengers/passengers`, y=prop_survival) )
plot2 + 
  geom_point()+
  ## Since we keep repeating this we could assign it to an object and just use the name of the object.
  ggtitle("Relationship between the survival rate and proportion of female passengers")

 
plot3 <- ggplot(ships, aes(x=`Length of voyage`, y=prop_survival) )
plot3 + 
  geom_point()+
  ## Since we keep repeating this we could assign it to an object and just use the name of the object.
  ggtitle("Relationship between the survival rate and number of female passengers")


```

  
```{r}  



```

Now let's create a new variable by using the or operator |  that is true for both 
your ship and the Titanic.
Remember that in this kind of logic, if for any observation either A is TRUE OR B is TRUE then
the new variable is TRUE.

We would write that:

newvariable <- A | B

In this case the new variable will be called two_ships and the data set is ships.
So we would  write 
ships$two_ships <- ships$Titanic | ships$yourship

Write that code and create the new plot below.

```{r}


```


### Write a few sentences about how your ship and the Titanic compare to each other and to the other ships.
 
 
  
  Now let's create a geom_hline() for the mean of number of male passengers and a geom_line() for the 
  mean number of female passengers.  
  You learned to do this in the second boxplot template. 
  If needed, review the code from there and modify to use the mean() function instead of quantile(). 
  Create the two lines and add to your plot. 
  
  Note that you could put the whole plot, with the lines and the title into an object.
  This will make the last two plots less subject to error because you don't have to retype your code.
  
```{r}  



```

### How do the values of the variables for the two ships compare to the two means? 






Next we will make two more plots that add "smoothers" 
geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)
geom_smooth(method="loess",se=FALSE)

Also make the same plots with se= TRUE.

```{r}  





```

### How do the two smoother lines differ? Why would each be useful?



### How do the two ships relate to the straight (lm) lines without the ribbons? 
### Are they nearer to the smoothed lines or to the mean lines?


### How do the two ships relate to the smoothed lines with the "ribbons"? 
### Do they fall inside the ribbons or outside the ribbons?


Use the code below to get the number of male passengers on the Titanic and your ship.

```{r}
# Numbor of male passengers on the Titanic
ships$No_of_male_passengers[ships$`Name of Ship` == "RMS Titanic"]
#Number of male passengers on your ship


```

### Explain the logic of the code for getting the specific values.



### Based  No. of women passengers for the Titanic, what value do the smooth lines
### have for No_of_male_passengers?  How does this compare to the actual number? 



### Based  No. of women passengers for the your ship, what value do the smooth lines
### have for No_of_male_passengers?  How does this compare to the actual number?


### How do the smoother lines relate to the vertical and horizontal lines showing the means?
