Data wrangling in the process of working with a data set you have and making it more usable.
This can include doing such things as:  

  * correctly assigning NA values.  
  * making the variable names or labels more useful.  
  * making sure the variables have correct levels of measurement  
  * recoding variables  
  * creating new variables from existing variables.  
 
We have already done some of this informally. This lab will tie together several examples and show
you how to save your modified file for future use. 

 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')

```

Previously we learned how to use dplyr::rename to change variable names to ones that are shorter and don't contain spaces.  That code is given below to start you off.

Rename at least 3 more variables. Follow the same pattern and make sure that the ')' is at the 
very end of the command.


````{r}

ships <-dplyr::rename(ships, 
                      Days = `Length of voyage`, 
                      Women_passengers = `No. of women passengers`)

````

The `ships` data set contains an assortment of variables that describe the ships, the collectivity
of passsengers, and the disaster.   
If we think them through logically we can use them to create additional helpful variables.

First let's create two new variables, the number of male passengers and the number of crew members.
Remember that in the original data set `No. of passengers` is the total passengers, 
`No. of women passengers` is the number of women
passengers, and `Ship size ` is the total number of people including passengers and crew.

#### How would you use these variablesto find the number of male passengers?


#### How would you use these variables to find the number of crew members?




Set up the code below to create the new variables.

Remember that you will have to use the new names you created if you modified the variable 
names you need.

````{r}

ships$No_of_male_passengers <- 
ships$No_of_crew <- 

````

Now get the summary data for the number of male passengers, number of women passengers and 
number of crew members. (Remember the function you need to get this)
```{r}

```

_When data wrangling it is always important to check your results as you go along. Make sure
that they make sense logically (sanity check).  For example the number of male passengers should
not be higher than the number of passengers!._

### How do the three variables compare to each other in terms of central tendency (mean and median) and 
### variation (range and interquartile range)?
(Feel free to use additional R functions of your choice to get this information)


Elander and Erixson suggest that there may be important differences in gender norms after
World War I. World War I ended in November 1918, so lets create a new variable that 
divides the years into two groups, up through 1918 and after 1918 using the cut() function.

Your code should look like this:
 `   cut(ships$Year, breaks = c(min(ships$Year), 1919, max(ships$Year)), labels = c("1918 or earlier", "After 1918"), include.lowest = TRUE)  `
 
 But you should assign it to a new variable in the ships dataset.  Also if you changed the variable
 name of Year you should adjust the code.
 
 #### What does the 1919 represent?
 
 
 #### Why is it smarter to use min() and max() instead of looking up the exact year by viewing the 
 #### dataset? 
 
 
 #### What do you think the include.lowest argument does?   Is there another way you could have 
 #### achieved the same thing? 
 
 

```{r}

```


You need to check your recoding.  Do this by first running a frequency()   on your new variable and 
making sure that the numbers look reasonable and that all 18 ships have values.

Then check in more detail by running a cross tabulation of the year variable and your new variable.

This is what the crosstabulation code  should look like, but with your variable names.

   crosstab(ships, row.vars = "Time_period", col.vars = "Year")             


```{r}



```

#### Why do you think it is important to check your work when you modify data?

Once you are satisfied with your data wrangling, you should save your own individualized copy 
of the ships data set.   

First create a folder called data in the files tab using the "New Folder" button.

Let's call the new dataset myships.   First assign the ships data to myships. Then use the save 
command as shown.


```{r}
# Do the assignment first (you need to supply the code).

# Now save.
save(file = "data/myships.Rda", myships)

```

Now in the future you will be able to load (using the load() command) your individualized dataset. But if you need to you
can always get the original ships data back from the lehmansociology package. 

Documenting your changes to code is one of the important features of "reproducable research." 
Someone else should be able to look at your files and understand exactly what you did and 
why you did it.   

This also helps you because you might come back to the work after several months of not working on
it or because something needs to be updated in some way. 

#### Why do you think that doing reproducible research is considered a best practice? 



#### Why does using a markdown file with both text and code help with reproducible research?
