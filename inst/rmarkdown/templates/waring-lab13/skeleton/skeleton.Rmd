In this lab you will be doing some basic regression models for your ship.
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')

```

Load the data set for your ship 

````{r}
load("")
```

Let's make nicer labels. We are making a new variable for Survival here because we need it to
be a number (not a factor) later.
```{r}
DATASETNAME$Survival_nominal<- factor(DATASETNAME$Survival, levels = c("0","1"), labels = c("Died", "Survived"))
DATASETNAME$Gender<- factor(DATASETNAME$Gender, levels = c("0","1"), labels = c("Male", "Female"))
DATASETNAME$Crew<- factor(DATASETNAME$Crew, levels = c("0","1"), labels = c("Passenger", "Crew"))


```


For comparison purposes let's run a frequency of Survival_nominal and crosstabs of Survival_nominal
with Gender and Crew.
For the third crosstab make a copy and switch the order of your column variables.

```{r}

frequency(DATASETNAME$Survival_nominal)
crosstab( DATASETNAME, row.vars = "Survival_nominal", col.vars = "Gender", 
          title ="Surival by Gender")
crosstab( DATASETNAME, row.vars = "Survival_nominal", col.vars = "Crew", 
          title ="Surival of Crew and Passengers")
# This cross tab will control for two variables.
crosstab( DATASETNAME, row.vars = "Survival_nominal", col.vars = c("Crew", "Gender"), 
          title ="Surival by Gender and Group")


```



Now we will run 3 regressions. First one without any independent variables, then one with Gender, then one with 
Gender and Crew.
We use the lm() function which means *l*inear *m*odel.

````{r}

lm(Survival ~ 1, DATASETNAME)
lm(Survival ~ Gender, DATASETNAME)
lm(Survival ~ Gender + Crew, DATASETNAME)

````

Write out the three equations below:

No independent variable:



Gender only:


Gender and Crew:




Calculate the predicted values for each the equation with no indepdent variable:

How does the equation relate to the frequency distribution results?


Calculate the predicted values for males and females for the Gender only model.


Did being female help or hurt or make no difference? 


How do these results compare to the cross tab for gender? 


For the equation with Gender and Crew as independent variables, calculate the predicted values for:

Female, Crew
Female, Passenger
Male, Crew
Male, Passenger

Which group has the best predicted probability of surviving?

Did Gender have an effect that was positive, negative or close to 0? 

Did it stay the same as the equation for Gender alone? If not, how did it change?


Did Crew have an effect that was positive, negative or close to 0?


How do the predicted values from the equation with two variables compare to the crosstabs?
