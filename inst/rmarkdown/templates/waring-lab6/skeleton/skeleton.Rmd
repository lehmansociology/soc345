Before starting this template make sure that you have the saved data set called myships.Rda in the 
data folder. If you do not have it at all you need to go back and re-run the data wrangling lab.
If the name is different you need to change the code chunk below to match it.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
load(file="~/data/myships.Rda")

```

Now that you have your data, run a frequency for your time period variable (whatever name you 
gave it--make sure to check this).
Also run a frequency table for the Quick variable making sure you use the correct name if 
you changed it.

````{r}
frequency(myships$timeperiod)
````

Now we will separate the ships into two separate data sets using the time period variable.
The example shows you to get the earlier group. You need to add the code to get the data set with
just  the later group.

```{r}
shipsearly<-subset(myships,myships$timeperiod == "1918 or earlier")
shipslate<- 

```

How can you check your work and make sure you have the right number of observations
and right ships? 


Do that now, either with code or explain in another way.



Now run frequency tables for Quick for the two new data sets.

```{r}

```

####Are the two time periods similar or different in terms of the chances of sinking quickly?
Describe what you see in the results.



Now get the mean proportion surviving for the two time periods using the two data sets.

```{r}

```


###How do they compare? Do the two time periods differ in terms of mean proportion surviving?





Could we make these analyses more compact?  Yes!

If we go back to our complete data set (myships) we can use other functions that help us make
comparisons.

For Quick, since it is a nominal variable, let's use the cross tab function with
time period as the column (x) variable (because it is the indepenent variable) and 
Quick as the row (y) since it is the dependent.  Make sure to add a title.

Next add crosstab() with format="col_percent".  With the independent variable in the column, the
column percent lets us compare the groups defined by the independent variable.

```{r}
crosstab(myships, row.vars = "Quick", col.vars = "timeperiod", format="freq", title = "")


```

### How do the crosstabs relate to the separate analyses we did earlier?

Do a second crosstab with a different variable of your choice

```{r}

```

### Describe your results.


Now use your two data sets to get the mean proportion surviving for the two time periods.

```{r}



```

### How do the tme periods compare? 

Now let's get the means without using separate data sets. We will use dplyr to do this.
Be sue to check your variable names. 

 Once you have seen how it works, using commas, add at least two more interval variables to 
 the analysis and also add the variance using var(). 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
myships_grouped <- group_by(myships, timeperiod)
dplyr::summarise(myships_grouped, 'Prop Surviving' = mean(prop_survival))
```

### How did the two time periods compare?  


### Which way do you perfer the presentations, as separate tables or as combined table?
