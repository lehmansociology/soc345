This template will explor interval ratio variables in  the _ships_ data using the concept of
quantiles and the special named quantiles, the median and quartiles. 
This will let us do two things
 - describe the overall distribution of the ships data numerically.
 - describe how your ship compares to this overall distribution.
 
Start by loading the lehmansociology library and renaming some of the variables.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
# Let's rename the Length of Voyage  variable to a shorter name with no spaces.
ships <-dplyr::rename(ships, 
                      Days = `Length of voyage`, 
                      Women_passengers = `No. of women passengers`)
```

Numeric variables (ratio or interval) have the special characteristics that they can be 
sorted from low to high (or high to low) and there is a fixed distance between values meaning
that the distance from 2 to 3 is the same as the distance from 7 to 8 or 99 to 100.  

Ordinal variables also can be sorted, but they do not have a fixed distance. So for example, size divided up into small,
medium or large or class divided into upper class, middle class, lower class do not have numeric
values that can be added or subtracted. 



In previous work, we divided our sample of ships into halves and then quarters based on the number 
of days in the voyage.  One thing that we saw is that it is not so easy to do this when
there are ties (observatiosn with the same values) or even numbers (because there are a range 
of values that could all be used to do the dividing).

How exactly to solve these problems is something that statisticians have tried to solve in a 
variety of ways.

Do ?quantile and scroll down to read about "Types".

#### How many different ways will R let you calculate quantiles?  Which one is the default? 
(Don't worry if you don't understand the details, just notice that they are different!)

#### What are the two groups?

Now let's use the different ways of calculating quantiles on the Days data. Use the first
one as an example and then add your own.

```{r}
quantile(ships$Days, probs=c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1), type = 1)



```

#### What do the probs represent?


####  How do the first three calculations differ from the later ones? Why do you think that is?


####  Did any of the calculations agree with what you got by hand? If not how did they differ?


 
#### Do you think the differences in results are important? Why might they be important in some 
#### cases but not others?



Try using the fivenum() and summary() function on Days.  
```{r}



```

#### Which version of quantiles do you think fivenum and summary use?




summary() is an important R function that is used on many different kinds of data.
