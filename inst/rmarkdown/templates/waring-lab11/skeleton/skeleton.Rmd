In this document we will be constructing confidence intervals using R instead of statkey or 
using hand calculations.

This assumes that you have saved your mysample1 and mysample2 data sets to the data folder. 

Now read the file.  You will need to get the "full path" to your data files.
You can do this by going to file Files tab and finding the file and clicking on their name.
Look at the load command that apppears in your console.  

You have done this before, look at your previous lab if you don't remember how.

```{r readfiles}

load(file = "change to your mysample1 file")
load(file = "change to your mysample2 file")
```

 
```{r loadlibraries, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
library(resample)

```




The code below creates a boot strap sample of the mean

````{r }
# This example takes 1000 samples and calculates a 95% Confidence Interval (the default)
# for the mean.
result1 <- bootstrap(mysample1, mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE), R = 1000)
CI.bca(result1)

# To get a 90% Confidence interval do this
CI.bca(result1, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))

#Now on your own get a 99% confidence interval



````
Explain in your own words why a 95% confindence interval would be displayed with the labels
2.5% and 97.5%.

How is a 99% confidence interval labelled?  Why is that?

Where to the values for "probs = " come from?


Copy and paste your code so that you get at least 4 different confidence intervals. You
should: 
use at least two confidence levels and 
use at least two different values for number of samples. For example you could try 5000 or 500.




How did the estimates change when you changed your parameter values?



What patterns do you notice?


How did your results compare to the results from statkey?



Now we will use the traditional (parametric) way of calculating confidence intervals in R using the t statistic.
We will only do this for the mean.

Calculate the 90, 95 and 99 percent confidence intervals.
```{r }

ci1 <- t.test(mysample1$Age, conf.level = 0.90)
ci1$conf.int


```

If you were calculating the 95% confidence interval manually you would calculated it this way:
Lower end:  sample mean - 1.96 * sample standard deviation/square root (n)
Higher end:  sample mean + 1.96 * sample standard deviation/square root (n)
Calculate these below.

```{r}




```



How do these numbers compare to the values you got in the previous lab by using the formulas?

How do these values compare to the bootstrap values?


Overall the important thing to know about confidence intervals, whether calculated with bootstrap methods or parametric methods 
is that 95% of the time, following these procedures the confidence interval will contain the population mean.
BUT we never know if our confidence interval is one that does contain the population mean or does not.

It is very important to say this carefully because people often get confused about what the confidence interval represents.
