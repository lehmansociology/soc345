title: "Sampling People on the Titanic"
output: html_document

In this template we are going to look at the Titanic data and create two random
samples of people who were on the ship Titanic, 
each with 200 individuals. Then we will compare the samples to each
other and to the combined data.

All the people on the ship together are the population.
Each sample we select will be a random sample of the population.

In statistics when we say random sample we mean  each member of the 
population is _equally likely_ to be selected for the sample.

```{r startupcode, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(lehmansociology)


```

To do this exercise you will first need to reload your data set for the 
Titanic. This should be in your data folder. If not, you will have to make
adjustments to the code or redo the beginning of the Disaster1 template.

```{r}
# Note this could need to change depending on your folder structure.
load(paste("~","data/RMS_Titanic.Rda", sep="/"))
```


We will create two samples of size 200, mysample1 and mysample2. Copy the example and create your own code for mysample2.

````{r}
#type your code here

mysample1 <- sample_n(RMS_Titanic, 200, replace=TRUE)

````

We are going to be working with these samples for the next few classes.  Therefore we will save them, which you do using the R function save().
Go to the Files tab and create a folder called data if you do not have one already.
Use the example code to create code to save your second sample also.

You need to run the below code, but don't knit it, which is why there
is no r in the {}.
```{}
save(mysample1, file = "data/mysample1.RData")


```
When you are done saving you should see your two new data sets in the data folder.

In the future if you want to use them you can use the load() function:
load(file = "data/mysample1.RData").



# Analysis of random samples


One thing to know is that the mind can play tricks and does 
not understand the idea of random well. 
In a random distribution we do not expect the results to be perfectly
even. We also do not expect that an individual sample will match the
population perfectly.

Now let's look at some descriptive statistics for the 2 samples.

Use  summary(), and  var()  for the two samples to compare the age distributions in the two samples.

Use frequency() to look at the distribution Gender, Crew Passenger and Survival.
Remember that you make a crosstab table for one variable like this
crosstab(datasetname$variablename)

```{r sample_univariates}


```




## How do the separate samples compare to the complete RMS Titanic data?
(You need to do some analyses here in order to answer the question.)

```{r}



```



__Follow the instructions in Blackboard for sharing your data.__


## 1000 Samples!

As a last step we are going to try taking  1000 random samples of size 200
and look at the distribution of the mean age using a histogram. 


```{r}

x<-replicate(1000, { 
        xi<-sample_n(RMS_Titanic, 200, replace=TRUE)
        mean(xi$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
       }
    )

ggplot(data = as.data.frame(x), aes(x=x)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = .25)

```

### What does the distribution look like? 


### What value is the middle of the distribution?


### How do they compare to the values for the population (the full Titanic data set)? 


### What happens if you divide the standard deviation of the 
### whole Titanic data set by the square root of the sample size?
Function for square root is sqrt()
