We're going to get the state level percent poverty and percent less than high school.

````{r label="createdata"}
#type your code here
poverty13<-select (poverty.states, FIPStxt, Area_Name, PCTPOVALL_2013)
poverty13$FIPS.Code<-as.integer(poverty13$FIPStxt)

lessthanhighschool13 <- select(education.states, Area.name, FIPS.Code,                                Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013)

education_and_poverty<-merge(poverty13, lessthanhighschool13, 
                             by.x='FIPS.Code', by.y='FIPS.Code')

````

Now let's make a dotplot to show the distribution of the data for percent of the adult population that has less than a high school degree.

```{r label="dotplotEducation"}

ggplot(education_and_poverty,
       aes(x=Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013),
       scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL)) +
     geom_dotplot(binwidth=.25 ) +
     geom_rug() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  ggtitle("Fig # : Distribution of Percent of Adults with 
          Less Than a High School Diploma (for States)")

```

Now make a dot plot for percent of the population living in poverty. 
Copy the code inside the chunk and make appropriate changes.

```{r label="dotplotPoverty"}



```



Now let's get the summary data for both variables. (Use the example as a model for the second variable.) 

```{r label="summary"}

summary(education_and_poverty$PCTPOVALL_2013)


```

Write your summary of the two distributions here.

Last but not least, let's look at the relationship between the two variables by making a scatter plot.


```{r scatterplot = "scatterplot"}

ggplot(education_and_poverty,
       aes(x=Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013,
           y=PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = lm) +
  ggtitle("Fig # : Poverty Rate and High School Completion (for States)")

```


If you want to get fancy you can change:
    geom_point() 
    to 
    geom_text(aes(label = Area_Name))

What is the relationship between the percent with less than a high school diploma 
and the level of poverty in a state?

This code added a straight line to the plot. stat_smooth(method = lm) +

What is the slope (approximately)?


Write a sentence summarizing the relationship using the slope.
