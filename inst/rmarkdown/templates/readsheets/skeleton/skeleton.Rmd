```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
library('googlesheets')
library("ggplot2")


```

First we are going to read the Google spreadsheet into an R data set.

````{r read_sheet}

gs<-gs_url('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12D6k6Xji94pK4HdfgUNjPEJqM_sYIBigN_7pZuJ_Kug/pubhtml')
mydata<-gs_read(gs)


````

Now create the proportions

```{r create_proportions}
# Finish these commands 
# First calculate the total n
mydata$n<-

# Now use the n to calculation the proportions for each education level.
mydata$p.lt_hs<-    
mydata$p.hs_degree<-
mydata$p.some_college<-
mydata$p.college<-
  

```

Now create the cumulative proportions

```{r create_cum_percents}

mydata$p.hs_degree_or_less<-
mydata$p.some_college_or_less<-
mydata$p.college_or_less<-


```


Now let's look at the distribution of cumulative percents.

Fill in the missing information.  Make copies of this so you can make histograms 
for all three of the cumulative variables plus the less than high school variable.
WHy don't we have to make a cumulative variable for the less than high school variable?

You need to make sure to put the variable name in the aes()  layer.

```{r}

ggplot(mydata, aes(, fill="red")) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  labs(y = "Count",     x="") +
  xlim(0,1.05)+
  ggtitle("Fig # : ")



```

Write a paragraph about your results.
