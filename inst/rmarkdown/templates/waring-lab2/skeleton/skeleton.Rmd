This template will begin the exploration of the _ships_ data set as a whole. This will let us do two things
 - describe the overall distribution of the ships data.
 - describe how your ship compares to this overall distribution.
 
Start by loading the lehmansociology library and assigning the correct Ship Id for your ship to myshipid.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')

myshipid <- x # Put your ship id here

```

Let's learn a trick that lets us embed results right in the middle of a sentence.

My ship is `r ships[myshipid, "Name of Ship"]  ` and its nationality is 
`r ships[myshipid, "Nationality of the Ship"]  `.  It carried a total 
of `r ships[myshipid, "Ship size"] ` people.


Notice that by using the "tick marks" with the letter r at the beginning you can run R even outside
of a code chunk.  Remember that insid the [] the first value is the row and the second is the
column.

#### Add at least two sentences containing results about your ship here.



## Frequency tables (nominal variables)

Next let's look at the overall distribution of some nominal variables.
Nominal (or categorical) variables are those where the attributes (or values) are names and have no underlying 
numerical meaning.   We will use the frequency() function to create the tables.  
There is example code for a table about using the variable Cause.  Add a title, then add code for a frequency
table showing another nominal variable.

````{r}

frequency(ships$Cause, title = "Causes of Maritime Disasters in the ships data")

````

#### Write several sentences for each of the tables that describe t
he distributions.
This could include information about the number of different values, the mode (most common value), or other 
things you find interesting. Make sure to describe *both* tables.


#### Write out an example of calculating a percent using data from one of the tables.


## Displaying interval and ratio variables

Interval and ratio variables are numerical variables where there are fixed units. They can be
integers, which are discrete, or continuous. The variable `No. of women passengers` is discrete 
because that can only be whole numbers.  
The variable `Length of voyage` is continuous because time (number of days) 
could take on fractional values (even though in our data it does not). 
For both variables there is a fixed unit of measurement. That means the change of 1 unit is the same
whether changing from 5 to 6 or from 37 to 38.

Ratio variables are variables for which 0 is meaningful. A meaningful 0 makes it possible to say 
(for example) that one value is twice as big as another value, which would be 2:1 which is why 
it is called ratio. 

Let's start by displaying the `Length of voyage` and`No. of women passengers` using frequency() just
as we did for our nominal variables.

```{r}




```

#### Where does you ship fit in on these two tables? 




#### What are the modes (most common values) for these tables? What is different about these tables compared to the nominal ones?
The first one is kind of a trick question. 





While all interval and ratio variables will not have distributions like these, many of them will.
So how can we summarize them more effectively?  

One way is to use a cumulative distribution.   To create a cumulative distribution, make the 
same tables  but add `cumulative.percent = TRUE, cumulative.freq = TRUE` to your code.

```{r}



```

#### Look at the Cum. Percent column and compare it to the other columns.  In your own words
#### explain at least two ways that the Cum. Percent can be calculated using the other columns
#### and the Total.
