Downloading and creating the disaster data.
Before you start create a folder
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')

```

Type your text here.

````{r}
# First we will download the spreadsheet of data.  Make sure you have created a data folder before doing this.
# You don't need to do this again if you have already downloaded the data, but it won't hurt.
destination =paste(getwd(),"data/marinedisasters.xlsx", sep="/")
utils::download.file( 'http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2012/07/24/1207156109.DCSupplemental/sd01.xlsx', destfile = destination )

#This code gets you the exact names of the sheets containing the ship data. 
marinesheets<-readxl::excel_sheets( destination )
marinesheets

#Notice that not all the sheets about individual ships. We'll use some of the other information later.

# Now read that RMS Titanic sheet.  To get the data for another ship, replace with
# the name exactly as written in the spreadsheet.
RMS_Titanic<-readxl::read_excel( destination, sheet="RMS Titanic", na =".")

Your_Ship_Name<-readxl::read_excel( destination, sheet="Your Ship Name", na =".")
````

Now we will save the two data sets you have created. 

```{r}
save(RMS_Titanic, file = paste(getwd(),"data", "RMS_Titanic.Rda", sep="/"))

save(Your_Ship_Name, file = paste(getwd(), "data","Your_Ship_Name.Rda", sep="/"))


```
